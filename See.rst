Small test

Here is a paragarph.

.. math::
  α_t(i) = P(O_1, O_2, … O_t, q_t = S_i λ)

.. math:: \\sigma_\\mathrm{mean} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}
   :label: math-sample-rst
   
Math :math:`\\frac{ \\sum_{t=0}^{N}f(t,k) }{N}` does not seem to work

Double blackslashing things also does not work :sadface:

.. code-block:: ruby

  print "Hello, World!\n"

Code does work though.
